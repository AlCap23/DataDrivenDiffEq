prob = ContinuousDataDrivenProblem(X, t, U = control)

# And plot the problems data.

# Again, we will use `gDMD` to estimate the systems dynamics. Since we have a control signal 
# defined in the problem, the algorithm will detect it automatically and use `gDMDc`:

res = solve(prob, DMDSVD(), digits = 1)

# We see that the system has been recovered correctly, indicated by the small error and high AIC score of the result. We can confirm this by looking at the resulting [`Basis`](@ref)
# And also plot the prediction of the recovered dynamics
