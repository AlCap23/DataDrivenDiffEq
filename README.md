# DataDrivenDiffEq

Early prototypes for data driven modelling of differential equations in Julia.

# To Do

The code in this repo is based upon several papers which are not cited yet. This will happen in the next few days.

# Ideas

- Implement SInDy Algorithm
- Implement Sparse Regression with Optim for reducing the Basis functions
- Allow any generic parsing of functions for the BasisCandidates
